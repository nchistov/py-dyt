## Variables in _DyT_

---

Variables are text between two `$`.
It replaces with the following values.

---

Simple usage:

```text
Hello $name$!
```

`$name$` is variable, but the name of the variable is `name`.

If you transform this _DyT_ into text with variable `name` equals to `Bob`, you get this text:

```text
Hello, Bob!
```
